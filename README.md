# Adagio-PIC-FP
PIC code for Adagio front panel.

# Overview
This project was created as I had a Crestron Adagio AAS-2 Audio Server with a broken motherboard, and the idea was born to replace the broken motherboard with a Raspberry Pi. After a little investigation it was clear that the panel was based around a PIC 16F874, further more the I2C connections for the PIC were connected to the front panel IDC header.
